	Roblox Universal Full-Body VR
</div>
PS: This is a modified version of sauceVR to work with newer Roblox. (and solara cuz its one of the only exploits remaining out there) Unfortunately, I'm not that good with FE scripting, and I couldn't make your movements show up for others. The only movement others are gonna see is you weirdly flailing around with your full body. Pretty sure it's a netless issue, gonna try fixing this in the near future.
